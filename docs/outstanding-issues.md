# Outstanding Issues & Follow-ups

A register of **open code-level work** — issues found but left out of scope, bugs,
refactors deferred because they were too much churn, and things that warrant a
closer look later. **Add entries as they surface; delete them once resolved (record
the fix in the commit/PR). This doc tracks only outstanding work, never history.**

It is **not** a checklist for routine verification (running test / e2e / CSP
suites), release process (commit / PR / merge), or already-settled design decisions
— those belong in CI, the PR, or the relevant spec/memory.

The register is repo-wide: tag each entry with an `area`.

## How to add / update an entry

- Copy the template below, give it the next free `OI-NNN`, append it under `Open`.
- **Statuses:** `OPEN` (actionable now) · `DEFERRED` (blocked on a decision or
  another change).
- Keep the one-line metadata: `area · opened YYYY-MM-DD by <name/agent> · P0–P3`
  (P0 = ships-blocking, P3 = nice-to-have).
- When an entry is resolved, **delete it** — record the fix in the commit/PR.

```
### [OPEN] OI-000 — <short title>
area · opened YYYY-MM-DD by <who> · P2
<the code issue / bug / investigation, why it matters, and how to resolve>
```

## Open

- **OPEN · background jobs / semantic search · 2026-09-11 · P1:** [Production synapse scans repeatedly time out](tickets/production-synapse-scan-statement-timeout-backlog.md); deploy the current execution cutover, then prove the inherited backlog converges without new unexpected timeouts.
- **OPEN · infrastructure · 2026-09-09 · P1:** [Docker Desktop VM crashes block trustworthy database/process verification](tickets/docker-desktop-virtualization-crash.md); recover the shared engine, then clean only owned interrupted resources and repeat the blocked checks.
